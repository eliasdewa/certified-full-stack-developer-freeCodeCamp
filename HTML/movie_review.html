        <strong>Review:</strong> "Green Book" is a heartwarming and inspiring
        film that tells the true story of an unlikely friendship between a
        working-class Italian-American bouncer and an African-American classical
        pianist during the 1960s. The performances by Viggo Mortensen and
        Mahershala Ali are outstanding, bringing depth and authenticity to their
        characters. The film beautifully explores themes of racism, acceptance,
        and the power of music to bridge divides. With its engaging storytelling
        and emotional resonance, "Green Book" is a must-watch for anyone who
        appreciates a well-crafted narrative.
